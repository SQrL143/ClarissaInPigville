# Clarissa in Pigville : Shopping with Nana

This is a web story. where a page of a book with illustration and story elements are renderd as a picture with a caption.

 It is based in the Haikus for Codespaces project. It is also based on the [Azure node sample](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/nodejs-docs-hello-world). It's great!!!

Point your browser to [Quickstart for GitHub Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/getting-started/quickstart) for a tour of using Codespaces with this repo.
